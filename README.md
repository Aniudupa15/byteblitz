we have created an extention which detects dark patterns and lists it down in the dark patterns and flags them

Installation: 
1. download the file from the repository
2. open extentions tab in ur required browser
3. enable developer Mode
4. click on Load unpacked
5. Select the file you downloaded from our github repository
6. once the extention is loaded paste the link in the given section
7. click on Analyse the Web Site

How it works??
when you provide the link to the extention it extracts the source code from the website and check for matching sentences from the source code and dataset and gives the user the output

Customization:
you can change the dataset to get other custom output or analyse any patterns
